Git "add" command adds modified or new files to the "staging area" that is ready for a commit. The git "commit" command creates a record of the changes added to the staging area. This allows developers to look at the history of changes. Finally, the git "push" command allows developers working locally to upload their change history or "commits" to the online repositories.
